Since ancient history, humans have looked up into space and wondered: are we alone? There are an estimated 1 billion trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) stars in the universe, and it wasn't until 1992 (!) that scientists discovered an exoplanet (a planet orbiting a star other than our own). Thanks to new technology, we now know that not only do exoplanets exist, but they are actually common in the universe! In this notebook, you will learn about transit photometry, the state-of-the-art method used by astronomers and astrophysicists for detecting exoplanets. You will gain experience with visualizing light curves and vetting them for exoplanets.

In the later notebooks of this project, you'll use machine learning to automate the search for exoplanets, using a variety of models and data augmentation techniques!
